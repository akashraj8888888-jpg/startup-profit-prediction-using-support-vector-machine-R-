This project uses Support Vector Machine Regression (SVR) to forecast a startup’s future profits based on key business features.
It applies data preprocessing, feature scaling, and model training to ensure accurate and stable predictions.
SVR’s ability to capture non-linear relationships helps model complex startup growth patterns.
The system evaluates performance using metrics like R² score and MAE for reliable assessment.
Its predictions can support founders and investors in making informed, data-driven financial decisions.
